In 2016, I coded my first website. No AI. No templates. Just a text editor and pure imagination.

In 2025, I’m bringing that feeling back.

**Retro Vibes Web** is an open-source series of nostalgic web designs—crafted in pure HTML, CSS, and that pixel-perfect care we all remember. These aren't templates. They’re time machines.

## ✨ Why This?

We’re flooded with AI-built websites today—but where’s the *soul*? This is for everyone who misses the *vibe* of coding from scratch.

## 💾 What's Inside?

– Blinking banners, bold colors, visitor counters
- Personal pages with punchy design
– Original style, revamped
