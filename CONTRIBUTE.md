# Contributing to Retro Vibes Web

Welcome! We're reviving the spirit of the early internet—hand-coded websites with *soul*. If you're here, you're part of the vibe.

## 🌐 What Can You Contribute?

We're building a collection of **retro-inspired websites** made with love (and HTML/CSS). You can:

- Submit your own design (like a 90s homepage, old-school portfolio, etc.)
- Improve an existing one (add more flavor, fix bugs)
- Share nostalgic assets (GIFs, fonts, backgrounds)
- Help with documentation or translations

## 📁 How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repo**
2. **Clone your fork locally**
3. Create a new folder under `/designs/` with a name like `your-project-name/`
4. Add your files inside it:
   - Must include at least `index.html`
   - CSS is optional but welcome
   - Keep it **HTML/CSS-only** for maximum retro authenticity
5. Commit and push
6. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with:
   - A screenshot or short description of your design
   - Your nostalgia story (optional but awesome!)

## 🔁 PR Tips

- Keep your code clean and folder self-contained
- Avoid modern frameworks or heavy JS
- Bonus points for visitor counters, GIFs, blinking text, or `<marquee>` tags

## 🧠 Inspiration Ideas

- A fake fan site from the 2000s
- Personal "about me" page in Comic Sans
- MySpace tribute page
- Old-school portfolio or school project clone


## ✨ We encourage:
- 90s/2000s vibes
- Animated GIFs
- Fonts that scream Y2K
- Custom cursor styles
- Visitor counters, marquees, embedded music? Go wild.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Be kind. Inclusive. Respect diverse aesthetics and stories. All contributors are welcome regardless of skill level.

Let’s keep the web fun, weird, and personal.
